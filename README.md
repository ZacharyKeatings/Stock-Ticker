## Stock Ticker

The object of the game is to buy and sell stocks, and by so doing accumulate a greater amount of money than the other players. The winner is decided by setting a time limit at the start of the game, and is the person having the greatest amount of money when time elapses, after selling his stocks back to the Broker at their final market value.

#### Features:

* Game runs completely from console
* Game playtime is measured by rounds played
* Can be played with 2 to 8 players, with the option of including bots in the game
* A probability simulation mode can be run by setting at least 2 bots and no human players
* Uses a dictionary variable to store player data during session
* Stock names, initial stock prices, initial player money can all be customized

#### Project Status:

This is an ongoing project which will be updated as I learn more about Python.

#### To-Do:

* Add text padding to curPlayerInfo() and currentPrices()
* Add bot sell stock ability
* Clean up the menu display code and formatting
* Rename function and variable names to follow Python recommended formatting
* Add option to save game
* Add networking option to allow players to play remotely together 

#### Inspiration:

This is based on the now out of print board game, Stock Ticker, published by Copp Clark Publishing Company.
