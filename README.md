## Stock Ticker

The object of the game is to buy and sell stocks, and by doing so, accumulate a greater amount of money than the other players by the end of the game. You can choose how many bots play along, as well as how many human players, and how many rounds. There is basic form of a bot, which buys stocks based on the current price and money on hand. The bots do not yet sell stocks, and I don't know if that feature will be added.
