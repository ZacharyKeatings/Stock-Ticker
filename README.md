## Stock Ticker

The object of the game is to buy and sell stocks, and by so doing accumulate a greater amount of money than the other players. The winner is decided by setting a time limit at the start of the game, and is the person having the greatest amount of money when time elapses, after selling his stocks back to the Broker at their final market value.

#### Note:

* StockTicker is the original version I created in November 2020.
* StockTickerRewrite is a completely new codebase which utilizes classes for better organization and compartmentalization. The rewrite also has fully functioning bots, with 3 different play styles.

#### Features:

* Game runs completely from console
* Game playtime is measured by rounds played
* Can be played with 2 to 8 players, with the option of including bots in the game
* A probability simulation mode can be run by setting at least 2 bots and no human players
* Bots can be assigned 1 of 3 different approaches. The first is a low risk model, which doesn't buy too high, or risk a stock splitting. The second model plays in the middle. They will get closer to the edges without going overboard. The third model is high risk. They never sell, and buy very high and very low.

#### Project Status:

This is an ongoing project which will be updated as I learn more about Python.

#### To-Do:

* Add option to save game
* Add networking option to allow players to play remotely together
* Use a GUI library to package as a .exe or other forms.

#### Inspiration:

This is based on the now out of print board game, Stock Ticker, published by Copp Clark Publishing Company.
